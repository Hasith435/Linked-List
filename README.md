# Linked-List
This file contains a library that creates a linked list in python. 
Functionality includes:
1. Adding elements to the beginning of the list
2. Adding elements to the end of the list
3. Adding elements in between two elements
4. Getting the index of an element present on the list
5. Remove an element from the list given its index

Indexing in this linked list works like the indexing on normal python lists, with the first element having an index of 0.
